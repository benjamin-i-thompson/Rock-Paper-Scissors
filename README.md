# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Simple game of Rock, Paper, Scissors to be played against the computer. Uses the random library to pick a random number between 1 and 3 as the computers choice of rock, paper, or scissors.

# Intro

main.py is the main program needed to run the game of Rock Paper Scissors. User types in 'rock' 'paper' or 'scissors when run to select their choice and the computer uses a function to randomly pick one of the three. The choices are compared and outputs whether you win, lose, or tie. The user can type 'q' to quit.

Currently working on using tkinter to make the game be played in a seperate window as apposed to the command line.
